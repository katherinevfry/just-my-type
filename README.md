# Just My Type

## Overview
Just My Type uses the Google Fonts API to show the user a random font. The user will then either click a button to see a new font, or have the option to save that font. A user must log in to save the font. Once authenticated, a user can sort or categorize their saved fonts (e.g., they could create a new project and save fonts to use in that project.) In my former life as a graphic designer, I spent SO MUCH TIME just looking at fonts. This would have helped me discover new fonts and save them, since I am also a forgetful person above all else.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to see a random font at the click of a button, so I can find new typefaces.
- As a user, I want to sign in so I can see fonts that only I have saved.
- As a user, I want to create categories and organize my fonts by category.
- As a user, I want to delete fonts, delete categories, or remove fonts from categories.
